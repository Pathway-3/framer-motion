# Framer Motion

The project was to use framer motion to animate the three images. It was done with the following features: scale, rotation and opacity.

## Features

- Scale: I scaled the image to twice the size of the image and back to original size.

- Rotate: I rotate the image by 360 degrees and scaled the image as is turns.

- Opacity: I made the image transparent and back to original image on hover.

- Layout: The layout is a flex

## Code for the motion project.

Here is my code that I used.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
